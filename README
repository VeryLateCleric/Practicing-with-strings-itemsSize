In this lesson we learn about substring which works as follows:

<!-- function sentenceCase(sentence) {

  const first = sentence.substring(0, 1);

  const rest = sentence.substring(1);


  return first.toUpperCase() + rest.toLowerCase();

} -->

substring() returns the part of the string from the start index up to but exluciding the end index, or to the end if no end index is supplied.
    The index of the first character to include in the substring

    The index of the first character to exclude from the substring (optional)

The above function works as follows:

    It sets the first variable to be equal to only the first character. In other words, substring(0, 1) means that the substring will begin on index 0 and will exclude the rest of the text starting on index 1. For example, "hello".substring(0, 1) returns h, and "hello".substring(0, 2) returns he.

    It sets the rest variable to be equal to every character starting from the first index. If you do not include a second argument, like in substring(1), the substring will consist of every character following the given index. For example, "hello".substring(1) returns ello.

    It joins the two strings together, using toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() as appropriate.
